   * Linear Data Structure
   * Follows FIFO principle: First In First Out
   * Insertion can take place from rear end
   * Deletion can take place from front end
   * 4 major operations:
   * enqueue(element) - used to insert element at rear end
   * dequeue() - removes element at front end
   * peekfirst() - get first element of the queue (front end)
   * peeklast() - get last element of the queue (rear end)
   * All operations are O(1) complexity
   * *********************
   * Applications
   * Scheduling
   * Mantaining playlist
   * Interrupt handling
   * *********************
   * Queue is a built-in JAVA Interface
   * it has to be extended by interfaces and classes
   * Queue belongs to collection package of JAVA
   * before implementing enqueue/dequeue emptiness of queue need to be checked
